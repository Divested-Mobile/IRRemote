IRRemote
=========

IR Remote control for Android devices.

With this app you can remote control about any TV that works with infra red.

The app uses [the database from GlobalCaché](http://irdatabase.globalcache.com) which contains over 100,000 Infrared codes for over 2,000 different remotes from over 500 manufacturers.


Requirements
============

For this app to work you will need an Android device running Android 4.3 or higher and a IR blaster.


Beta
====

Right now the app is still in beta, but it works perfectly, so if you want to try it, go ahead and install it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.twinone.irremote) or build it yourself by cloning this repo.
